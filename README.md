# Dashboard_Spotify
Crafted a dynamic dashboard showcasing Spotify- a music app's yearly data and analyzing and reporting on key performance indicators and other metrics. 
Methodology can be seen as above:
Downloaded and loaded a dataset i.e. "Spotify-2023.csv" from Kaggle. Designed a glass morphism background in PowerPoint presentations and used it as the canvas background for the dashboard. Used HTML visuals and Power BI's DENEB Visuals for an admirable appearance and also performed PBI formatting for the final touches. 
A perfect analysis is done in this project of the music app "Spotify" for the year 2023.
